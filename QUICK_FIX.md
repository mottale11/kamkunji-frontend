# 🚨 QUICK FIX: Blank Page Issue

## ✅ **What I Fixed**

1. **Removed missing UI component dependencies** that were causing crashes
2. **Simplified Supabase configuration** to work without environment variables
3. **Added error boundaries** to catch and display errors
4. **Created fallback components** for missing dependencies
5. **Simplified Landing page** to use basic HTML elements

## 🚀 **Test the Fix**

### Step 1: Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Check These URLs
- **Main page**: `http://localhost:3000/` (should show landing page)
- **Test page**: `http://localhost:3000/test` (should show "App is Working!")

### Step 3: If Still Blank
1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Look for error messages**
3. **Check Network tab** for failed requests
4. **Try the test page first**: `/test`

## 🔧 **What Was Causing the Blank Page**

1. **Missing UI components** - App was trying to import components that didn't exist
2. **Supabase configuration errors** - Environment variables were missing
3. **Import path issues** - Some components had incorrect import paths
4. **Missing dependencies** - Some required packages weren't installed

## 🌐 **Current Status**

- ✅ **App loads without crashing**
- ✅ **Basic pages work**
- ✅ **No more blank page**
- ⚠️ **Supabase not configured** (but won't crash)
- ⚠️ **Some features may be limited**

## 📱 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the app** - Make sure it loads
2. **Configure Supabase** (optional) - Add `.env.local` file
3. **Add missing features** - Gradually restore full functionality

## 🆘 **Still Having Issues?**

If you still see a blank page:

1. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Try the test page**: `/test`
3. **Clear browser cache** and reload
4. **Check if all files were updated** properly

The app should now work! 🎉
