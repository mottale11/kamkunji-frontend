SUPABASE SETUP FOR FRONTEND

To connect your frontend to Supabase:

1. Create a file called .env.local in the frontend directory
2. Add these lines (replace with your actual values):

VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

3. Get your values from:
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings â†’ API
   - Copy Project URL and anon public key

4. Restart your frontend dev server

The frontend will work without this file, but won't connect to your database.
